Q: How do I register for classes?
A: Registration is typically done through the university's online student portal. You will likely need to meet with your academic advisor first to discuss your course plan and get an access code or approval. Check the university's academic calendar for registration dates.

Q: What is a "credit hour"?
A: A credit hour is a unit used to measure academic work. Typically, one credit hour represents one hour of in-class instruction per week for a full semester (around 15 weeks). Most courses are 3 credit hours. Be aware that for every 1 credit hour, you should expect to spend 2-3 hours outside of class studying, reading, and doing homework.

Q: How is my GPA (Grade Point Average) calculated?
A: Your GPA is a weighted average of the grades you earn. Each letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) is assigned a point value (e.g., A=4.0, B=3.0). This value is multiplied by the number of credit hours for that course. All these points are added up and then divided by the total number of credit hours you've taken.

Q: What is the "add/drop" deadline?
A: This is a crucial date at the beginning of each semester. It's the last day you can add a new course to your schedule or drop a course without it appearing on your academic transcript and (usually) without financial penalty.

Q: Where can I get academic help or tutoring?
A: Most universities have several free resources. Check for:
1.  **Professor's Office Hours:** This is the best place to start.
2.  **Teaching Assistant (TA) Sessions:** TAs for your specific course often hold review or lab sessions.
3.  **University Tutoring Center:** Offers free peer tutoring for many introductory courses (math, science, writing).
4.  **Math/Writing Labs:** Specialized centers to help with math and writing skills.

Q: How do I get my student ID card?
A: You can typically get your student ID card from the Student Affairs or Registrar's office. You'll likely need a government-issued photo ID (like a passport or national ID) and proof of registration. Your student ID is essential for accessing the library, gym, labs, and sometimes even for meal plans.

Q: How do I join student clubs or organizations?
A: The best way is to attend the Student Activities Fair (or Club Fair) at the beginning of the semester, where all clubs have booths. You can also usually find a directory of all registered clubs on the university's student life website.

Q: How do I set up and use my university email?
A: Your university will assign you an official email address (e.g., your_id@university.edu). You should receive setup instructions from the IT department after you register. It is CRITICAL to check this email daily, as all official communications from professors and the administration will be sent there.

Q: What health services are available on campus?
A: Most universities have a student health center that offers basic medical care, counseling, and wellness services, often for free or at a low cost for students.

Q: When and how do I pay my tuition?
A: Tuition due dates are listed on the academic calendar. You can pay online through the student portal, or in person at the Bursar's Office (also called the Finance Office). Check the portal for your specific bill and any available payment plans.

Q: I have a question about my scholarship or student loan. Who do I talk to?
A: All questions related to scholarships, grants, and loans should be directed to the Financial Aid Office.

### New Student FAQ - Computer Science (CS) Major Questions

Q: What programming language will I learn first?
A: This depends on the university. Common first languages include Python (for its simple syntax), Java (for its object-oriented structure), or C/C++ (for its proximity to hardware and memory management). The specific language is less important than the concepts you learn: logic, variables, loops, functions, and problem-solving.

Q: How much math is in a Computer Science degree?
A: A significant amount. CS is fundamentally a branch of applied mathematics. You must be prepared to take:
1.  **Calculus (I and II):** Essential for understanding rates of change, used in fields like machine learning.
2.  **Linear Algebra:** Incredibly important for graphics, data science, and machine learning.
3.  **Discrete Mathematics:** This is the most important math for CS. It covers logic, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory, which are the building blocks of algorithms.
4.  **Probability & Statistics:** Core for AI, machine learning, and data analysis.

Q: What is the difference between Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE)?
A:
* **Computer Science (CS)** is more theoretical. It focuses on the "why" and "how" computers work. It covers algorithms, data structures, computational theory, and the fundamental principles of computing.
* **Software Engineering (SE)** is more practical. It focuses on the "how to build" reliable, efficient, and maintainable software systems. It covers project management, testing, software design patterns, and working in teams.
Think of it this way: A computer scientist invents a new, faster algorithm. A software engineer figures out how to implement that algorithm in a large, real-world application (like a banking system or a social media app) so it doesn't crash.

Q: Do I need to be good at hardware?
A: You don't need to be an electrical engineer, but you absolutely need to understand the basics. You will take courses like "Computer Organization" or "Computer Architecture." These teach you how a CPU, memory (RAM), and storage work together. Understanding this helps you write faster, more-efficient code because you know *what* the computer is actually doing.

Q: What are the most important courses in the CS major?
A: Without a doubt, the most important foundational courses are:
1.  **Data Structures:** Teaches you how to organize data (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs).
2.  **Algorithms:** Teaches you how to write efficient procedures to solve problems (e.g., sorting algorithms, graph traversal).
These two courses are the foundation for everything else in CS and are the main focus of technical job interviews.

Q: What is an "algorithm"?
A: An algorithm is just a step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem. Think of it as a recipe. A recipe gives you a list of ingredients (data) and a set of steps (the algorithm) to follow to produce a result (a cake). In CS, an algorithm tells the computer the exact steps to take to turn an input into a desired output.

Q: What are "tracks" or "specializations" in CS?
A: After you finish your core courses, you can often choose a "track" to focus on. Common tracks include:
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML):** Teaching computers to learn from data and make predictions.
* **Cybersecurity:** Protecting data and systems from attacks.
* **Web & Mobile Development:** Building applications for websites and phones.
* **Game Development:** Creating video games.
* **Data Science:** Analyzing large datasets to find patterns and insights.
* **Systems & Networking:** Building operating systems, computer networks, and cloud infrastructure.

Q: What kind of laptop do I need for a CS degree?
A: You don't need the most expensive one. Any modern laptop (Windows, macOS, or Linux) with at least 8GB of RAM (16GB is better) and a Solid State Drive (SSD) will be perfectly fine for the first two years. Your choice of operating system (OS) is a personal preference. Many CS students eventually prefer macOS or Linux because their command-line environments are very similar to the servers where code is often deployed.

Q: What is GitHub, and why do I need it?
A: GitHub is a website for hosting code using a version control system called **Git**. "Version control" is like "track changes" for your code. It lets you save snapshots (called "commits") of your project as you work, so you can easily go back to a previous version if you break something. It's also essential for collaborating with other programmers. You should create a GitHub account and start uploading all your personal projects and homework (if your professor allows it) right away. It becomes your portfolio.

Q: What is a "portfolio" for a CS student?
A: A portfolio is a collection of your personal projects that you can show to employers. This is arguably *more* important than your grades. A good portfolio shows what you can *build*. Start by creating simple projects you're passionate about (a simple game, a personal website, a data analysis script) and put them on your GitHub.

Q: When should I start looking for an internship?
A: Start learning about the process your first year, but start *seriously* applying after your second year. Most companies look for interns who have completed their Data Structures and Algorithms courses.

Q: What is "competitive programming"?
A: Competitive programming (CP) is a "mind sport" where you solve complex algorithmic problems within a strict time limit. It is excellent practice for technical interviews, as it forces you to get very good, very fast, at Data Structures and Algorithms. Platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and AtCoder are popular for this.
